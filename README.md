# SimpleWeather is a small SPA I do as a pet project.
### So it's still in development.

Hello! This is my first SPA using a combination of React and Redux.\
It implements the loading of data from API of [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)\
I also used the [MUI library](https://mui.com/) for buttons and a [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) to navigate through the pages.


## How to use
### 🐱‍🏍Go to the [gh-pages](https://keyofevergreen.github.io/weather-by-evergreen/)!
### Or

1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/keyofevergreen/SimpleWeather.git
```
2. Go to the cloned directory (e.g. cd weather-by-evergreen).
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3030/SimpleWeather) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.

### I would be glad to have any code review on your part :)
