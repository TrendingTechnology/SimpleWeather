# Weather app made as a pet project
## This app is still in development

Hello! This is my first SPA using a combination of React and Redux.\
It implements the loading of data from API of [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)\
I also used the [MUI library](https://mui.com/) for buttons and a [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) to navigate through the pages.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
